# Project Description

With this app, you can import your players data from Football Manager PC game via html file (you can download html file of players table from game), 
then it will calculate the overall skill for each position. 
Additionally, you have the flexibility to create your own weighting templates for any role, where you determine which attribute is essential for that position. 
It will make browsing the transfer market much more faster, allowing you to sort data by overall skill for each position based on your preferences. 
No need to manually check each player's attributes â€” the app does it for you according to your templates. 
The app supports multiple languages for your data views, and I'm open to adding more upon request. 
Click on any player's row to view their full attribute information. More informative tutorial [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvkNeuqOjqQ)
